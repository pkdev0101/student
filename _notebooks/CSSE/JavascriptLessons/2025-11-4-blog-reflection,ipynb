### Sprint 1 – Onboarding Challenge
---

## Task Overview
Sprint 1 was about setting up my personal development environment and learning how to manage code and workflows as a Learning Experience Designer. The main focus was on **VSCode**, **GitHub**, **Make**, and Linux commands to get my GitHub Pages site running.

## What I Actually Did
I started by creating my personal workspace:
- Used `mkdir -p <USERNAME>` to create a personal directory.
- Cloned the student repository using `git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/student.git`.
- Ran `./scripts/activate.sh` to configure GitHub credentials.
- Set up and activated a Python virtual environment with `./scripts/venv.sh` and `venv`.

Next, I installed all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
gem install faraday-retry
```
I had to debug multiple issues along the way, such as missing packages and misconfigured environment variables. Running Make commands like `make serve-minema` allowed me to serve the site locally and test changes before pushing.

I also practiced committing and pushing code to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup initial project"
git push origin main
```
Watching GitHub Actions trigger automatically and seeing my changes live on GitHub Pages was a key part of the experience.

## Challenges I Faced
- Make commands sometimes failed due to missing dependencies.
- Activating virtual environments in Kasm/Linux required troubleshooting.
- Ensuring the GitHub Pages site published correctly after multiple commits.

## What I Learned
- How to create directories and organize projects using Linux commands.
- How to clone and manage GitHub repositories effectively.
- How to run and debug Make commands for automation.
- How to configure and activate Python virtual environments.
- How GitHub Actions work to deploy GitHub Pages automatically.
- How to systematically troubleshoot errors and document solutions.

## My Favorite Part
Getting my site online and fully functional was very satisfying. Every bug I fixed and command I ran made me feel more confident in managing my own development environment.

## Overall Reflection

Sprint 1 taught me that a big part of coding is understanding the setup and tools. Running commands, troubleshooting, and managing repositories were all valuable skills I can build on. In the next sprint, I want to keep improving my workflow and start working on more complex projects with my personal GitHub Pages setup fully established.
