    "### Sprint 1 – Onboarding Challenge\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Overview\n",
    "Sprint 1 was about setting up my personal development environment and learning how to manage code and workflows as a Learning Experience Designer. The main focus was on **VSCode**, **GitHub**, **Make**, and Linux commands to get my GitHub Pages site running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Actually Did\n",
    "I started by creating my a personal workspace:\n",
    "- Used `mkdir -p <USERNAME>` to create a personal directory.\n",
    "- Cloned the student repository using `git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/student.git`.\n",
    "- Ran `./scripts/activate.sh` to configure GitHub credentials.\n",
    "- Set up and activated a Python virtual environment with `./scripts/venv.sh` and `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I installed all dependencies:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "gem install faraday-retry\n",
    "```\n",
    "I had to debug multiple issues along the way, such as missing packages and misconfigured environment variables. Running Make commands like `make serve-minema` allowed me to serve the site locally and test changes before pushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also practiced committing and pushing code to GitHub:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"Setup initial project\"\n",
    "git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "Watching GitHub Actions trigger automatically and seeing my changes live on GitHub Pages was a key part of the experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges I Faced\n",
    "- Make commands sometimes failed due to missing dependencies.\n",
    "- Activating virtual environments in Kasm/Linux required troubleshooting.\n",
    "- Ensuring the GitHub Pages site published correctly after multiple commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Learned\n",
    "- How to create directories and organize projects using Linux commands.\n",
    "- How to clone and manage GitHub repositories effectively.\n",
    "- How to run and debug Make commands for automation.\n",
    "- How to configure and activate Python virtual environments.\n",
    "- How GitHub Actions work to deploy GitHub Pages automatically.\n",
    "- How to systematically troubleshoot errors and document solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Favorite Part\n",
    "Getting my site online and fully functional was very nice to see. Every bug I fixed and command I ran made me feel more confident in managing my own development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint 1 taught me that a big part of coding is understanding the setup and tools. Running commands, troubleshooting, and managing repositories were all valuable skills I can build on. Sprint 1 set me up to keep improving my workflow and start working on more complex projects with my personal GitHub Pages setup fully established.\n",

    "### Sprint 2 – JavaScript Fundamentals\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Overview\n",
    "Sprint 2 focused on learning **JavaScript fundamentals** and applying them to small projects and games. The goal was to strengthen my understanding of variables, functions, loops, arrays, objects, and DOM manipulation, and to start building interactive experiences on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Actually Did\n",
    "I completed several JavaScript exercises and homework assignments, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practiced declaring **variables** using `let` and `const` for storing strings, numbers, and booleans.\n",
    "- Used **mathematical and logical operators** to perform calculations and make decisions in code.\n",
    "- Applied **conditionals** (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to control the flow of programs.\n",
    "- Iterated through arrays using **loops** (`for`, `while`, `for...of`) to perform repeated actions.\n",
    "- Created **functions** to organize reusable code for calculations, updates, and game actions.\n",
    "- Built **objects** to store structured data, including JSON-style objects for games.\n",
    "- Manipulated the **DOM** to display results, take user input, and update web pages dynamically.\n",
    "- Combined these skills to implement simple **game mechanics** like scoring, animation, and playlist shuffling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges I Faced\n",
    "- Debugging loops and functions when output wasn’t what I expected.\n",
    "- Properly connecting JavaScript with HTML elements for DOM manipulation.\n",
    "- Managing multiple objects and their properties in small game projects.\n",
    "- Understanding the flow of asynchronous events in a webpage.\n",
    "- Keeping track of variable scopes and ensuring functions accessed the correct data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Learned\n",
    "- How to declare and use **variables** effectively.\n",
    "- How to write and call **functions** to simplify repetitive tasks.\n",
    "- How to use **loops** and **conditionals** to control program flow.\n",
    "- How to organize data in **objects** and **arrays** for complex tasks.\n",
    "- How to dynamically update web pages using **DOM manipulation**.\n",
    "- How to combine these concepts to create small interactive games and tools.\n",
    "- How to debug errors systematically and read console logs for insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Favorite Part\n",
    "Creating the playlist shuffle was especially satisfying because it applied nearly all the concepts I had learned in a single, interactive project. Watching the songs display in order and seeing the program run in real time gave me confidence in my coding abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Reflection\n",
    "Sprint 2 reinforced the foundational concepts of programming in JavaScript. By practicing variables, functions, loops, objects, and DOM manipulation, I learned a lot from the JavaScript fundamentals. These skills will be essential as I move into more complex web development and game-based projects.\n"
