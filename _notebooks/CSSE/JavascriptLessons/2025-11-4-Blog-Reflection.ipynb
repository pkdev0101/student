    "### Sprint 2 – JavaScript Fundamentals\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Overview\n",
    "Sprint 2 focused on learning **JavaScript fundamentals** and applying them to small projects and games. The goal was to strengthen my understanding of variables, functions, loops, arrays, objects, and DOM manipulation, and to start building interactive experiences on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Actually Did\n",
    "I completed several JavaScript exercises and homework assignments, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practiced declaring **variables** using `let` and `const` for storing strings, numbers, and booleans.\n",
    "- Used **mathematical and logical operators** to perform calculations and make decisions in code.\n",
    "- Applied **conditionals** (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to control the flow of programs.\n",
    "- Iterated through arrays using **loops** (`for`, `while`, `for...of`) to perform repeated actions.\n",
    "- Created **functions** to organize reusable code for calculations, updates, and game actions.\n",
    "- Built **objects** to store structured data, including JSON-style objects for games.\n",
    "- Manipulated the **DOM** to display results, take user input, and update web pages dynamically.\n",
    "- Combined these skills to implement simple **game mechanics** like scoring, animation, and playlist shuffling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges I Faced\n",
    "- Debugging loops and functions when output wasn’t what I expected.\n",
    "- Properly connecting JavaScript with HTML elements for DOM manipulation.\n",
    "- Managing multiple objects and their properties in small game projects.\n",
    "- Understanding the flow of asynchronous events in a webpage.\n",
    "- Keeping track of variable scopes and ensuring functions accessed the correct data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Learned\n",
    "- How to declare and use **variables** effectively.\n",
    "- How to write and call **functions** to simplify repetitive tasks.\n",
    "- How to use **loops** and **conditionals** to control program flow.\n",
    "- How to organize data in **objects** and **arrays** for complex tasks.\n",
    "- How to dynamically update web pages using **DOM manipulation**.\n",
    "- How to combine these concepts to create small interactive games and tools.\n",
    "- How to debug errors systematically and read console logs for insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Favorite Part\n",
    "Creating the playlist shuffle was especially satisfying because it applied nearly all the concepts I had learned in a single, interactive project. Watching the songs display in order and seeing the program run in real time gave me confidence in my coding abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Reflection\n",
    "Sprint 2 reinforced the foundational concepts of programming in JavaScript. By practicing variables, functions, loops, objects, and DOM manipulation, I learned a lot from the JavaScript fundamentals. These skills will be essential as I move into more complex web development and game-based projects.\n"
