    "### Sprint 1 – Onboarding Challenge\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Overview\n",
    "Sprint 1 was about setting up my personal development environment and learning how to manage code and workflows as a Learning Experience Designer. The main focus was on **VSCode**, **GitHub**, **Make**, and Linux commands to get my GitHub Pages site running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Actually Did\n",
    "I started by creating my a personal workspace:\n",
    "- Used `mkdir -p <USERNAME>` to create a personal directory.\n",
    "- Cloned the student repository using `git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/student.git`.\n",
    "- Ran `./scripts/activate.sh` to configure GitHub credentials.\n",
    "- Set up and activated a Python virtual environment with `./scripts/venv.sh` and `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I installed all dependencies:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "gem install faraday-retry\n",
    "```\n",
    "I had to debug multiple issues along the way, such as missing packages and misconfigured environment variables. Running Make commands like `make serve-minema` allowed me to serve the site locally and test changes before pushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also practiced committing and pushing code to GitHub:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"Setup initial project\"\n",
    "git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "Watching GitHub Actions trigger automatically and seeing my changes live on GitHub Pages was a key part of the experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges I Faced\n",
    "- Make commands sometimes failed due to missing dependencies.\n",
    "- Activating virtual environments in Kasm/Linux required troubleshooting.\n",
    "- Ensuring the GitHub Pages site published correctly after multiple commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Learned\n",
    "- How to create directories and organize projects using Linux commands.\n",
    "- How to clone and manage GitHub repositories effectively.\n",
    "- How to run and debug Make commands for automation.\n",
    "- How to configure and activate Python virtual environments.\n",
    "- How GitHub Actions work to deploy GitHub Pages automatically.\n",
    "- How to systematically troubleshoot errors and document solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Favorite Part\n",
    "Getting my site online and fully functional was very nice to see. Every bug I fixed and command I ran made me feel more confident in managing my own development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint 1 taught me that a big part of coding is understanding the setup and tools. Running commands, troubleshooting, and managing repositories were all valuable skills I can build on. Sprint 1 set me up to keep improving my workflow and start working on more complex projects with my personal GitHub Pages setup fully established.\n",

    "## What I Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint 2 was all about diving deeper into **JavaScript** and applying it to small coding exercises and games. I focused on building a strong foundation in programming concepts while connecting them to interactive web projects. Here’s a breakdown of what I practiced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables and Data Types** – I worked with `let` and `const` to store numbers, strings, and booleans. Understanding the differences between these helped me manage data more effectively in my programs.  \n",
    "- **Operators and Expressions** – I used mathematical operators to perform calculations and logical operators to create conditions for decision-making in code.  \n",
    "- **Conditionals** – `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements became tools to control program flow and handle multiple scenarios, like checking player scores or determining game outcomes.  \n",
    "- **Loops** – I practiced `for` and `while` loops to iterate through arrays and perform repeated actions, which was useful for tasks like updating a scoreboard or managing multiple game objects.  \n",
    "- **Functions** – Writing reusable functions allowed me to break problems into smaller, manageable pieces, like calculating totals, updating stats, or running repeated animations.  \n",
    "- **Objects and JSON** – I created objects to group related data and practiced using JSON-style structures. This was especially helpful when managing properties of game objects like players, enemies, and items.  \n",
    "- **DOM Manipulation** – I used `document.getElementById` and `document.querySelector` to interact with HTML elements, allowing me to display dynamic content, take user input, and update the game interface in real-time.  \n",
    "- **Simple Game Logic** – Applying these concepts together, I experimented with small game mechanics, like moving objects, tracking scores, and responding to user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges and Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debugging was a big part of the process—figuring out why loops didn’t behave as expected or why functions returned unexpected results taught me patience and problem-solving skills.  \n",
    "- Integrating JavaScript with HTML was initially tricky, but it helped me understand how web pages respond to user actions.  \n",
    "- Managing multiple objects and their properties improved my organizational skills and reinforced how OOP concepts can be applied even in small projects.  \n",
    "- Collaborating with peers on exercises encouraged me to explain my code clearly and learn from others’ approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This sprint was a major step forward in my coding journey. By practicing **variables, loops, functions, objects, and DOM manipulation**, I gained confidence in writing interactive programs. The hands-on homework and small game projects taught me not just syntax, but how to **think like a programmer**: breaking problems down, testing solutions, and iterating until the code works. These skills will be the foundation for more advanced web development and game programming in upcoming sprints."
