    "### Sprint 1 – Onboarding Challenge\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Overview\n",
    "Sprint 1 was about setting up my personal development environment and learning how to manage code and workflows as a Learning Experience Designer. The main focus was on **VSCode**, **GitHub**, **Make**, and Linux commands to get my GitHub Pages site running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Actually Did\n",
    "I started by creating my Apersonal workspace:\n",
    "- Used `mkdir -p <USERNAME>` to create a personal directory.\n",
    "- Cloned the student repository using `git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/student.git`.\n",
    "- Ran `./scripts/activate.sh` to configure GitHub credentials.\n",
    "- Set up and activated a Python virtual environment with `./scripts/venv.sh` and `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I installed all dependencies:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "gem install faraday-retry\n",
    "```\n",
    "I had to debug multiple issues along the way, such as missing packages and misconfigured environment variables. Running Make commands like `make serve-minema` allowed me to serve the site locally and test changes before pushing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also practiced committing and pushing code to GitHub:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"Setup initial project\"\n",
    "git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "Watching GitHub Actions trigger automatically and seeing my changes live on GitHub Pages was a key part of the experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges I Faced\n",
    "- Make commands sometimes failed due to missing dependencies.\n",
    "- Activating virtual environments in Kasm/Linux required troubleshooting.\n",
    "- Ensuring the GitHub Pages site published correctly after multiple commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Learned\n",
    "- How to create directories and organize projects using Linux commands.\n",
    "- How to clone and manage GitHub repositories effectively.\n",
    "- How to run and debug Make commands for automation.\n",
    "- How to configure and activate Python virtual environments.\n",
    "- How GitHub Actions work to deploy GitHub Pages automatically.\n",
    "- How to systematically troubleshoot errors and document solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Favorite Part\n",
    "Getting my site online and fully functional was very nice to see. Every bug I fixed and command I ran made me feel more confident in managing my own development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint 1 taught me that a big part of coding is understanding the setup and tools. Running commands, troubleshooting, and managing repositories were all valuable skills I can build on. Sprint 1 set me up to keep improving my workflow and start working on more complex projects with my personal GitHub Pages setup fully established.\n",
